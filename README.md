# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms implemented using `c++` for UOM's CS2022 - Data Structures and Algorithms Module

## *Editor and Compiler configuration*

|Â |Configuration|
| :------------ | :---------- |
|Editor       | Atom (with TabNine Package installed)  |
|Compiler |g++ (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0 in WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)|

> g++ command is a GNU c++ compiler invocation command, which is used for preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking of source code to generate an executable file.

## *Compilation and Execution*

* `main.cpp` - Contains the Code
* `main.out` - Executable file generated by the compiler

Run following commands in the Linux Shell opened in the same directory as the `main.cpp`

```

:~$ g++ -Wall -o main.out -std=c++0x main.cpp                      //compilation
:~$ ./main.out                                                     //Execution

```
